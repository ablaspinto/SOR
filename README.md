### Approach 
Get information from specific Stock, and then use SOR, in order to break order, by first finding out all current prices from different trading 
Venues. Use data found by end of simulation in order to train model as well as visualize how profitable potential strategy used was in certain 
market conditions


### Take aways 
I should have used data that was older, in order 
to see if the model would be able to be profitable over a greater period of time.
Did not have enough time to complete task.
